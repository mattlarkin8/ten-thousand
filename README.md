# **LAB - Class 08**

## **Project: Ten Thousand**

### **Author: Matthew Larkin**

### **Setup**

#### Tests

Tests can be run using `pytest`. Use `pytest -k <test-file-name>` to run specific tests.
Use `pytest ./tests/version_1/test_calculate_score.py` to test only the `calculate_score` method.  
Use `pytest ./tests/version_1/test_roll_dice.py` to test only the `roll_dice` method.  

No automated tests for Lab07 right now. Check output using the sim files in `tests/version_2/`.

The program is currently *not* passing the Lab 08 tests.

## **Credit**

I worked with Alec Torres and Ryan McMillan when creating the `calculate_score` method.

Big thanks to JB for recommending that we rewrite our code using many small functions instead of one big one. My code is much more manageable now.
